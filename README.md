# Image-Toolkit
This kit is just a collection of functions I threw together in a console program to learn a little more about image processing. So far it includes:

- Image resizing using a few different interpolation methods
- Image rotation
- Contrast editing
- Gaussial blurring
- Edge detection
- An algorithm for encoding steganographic text messages within images
- An algorithm for finding and reading steganographic messages back
